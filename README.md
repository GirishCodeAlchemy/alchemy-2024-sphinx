# Alchemy Sphinx Tutorial

Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator that transforms plain text source files into various formats, such as HTML. In our case, it takes plain text files written in reStructuredText format and converts them into HTML files, making it easy to create professional-looking documentation for your projects.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and set up Sphinx for your project:

1. **Install Requirements**: First, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the required Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Initialize Sphinx**: Next, initialize Sphinx in your project directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sphinx-quickstart
   ```

   This command will guide you through the setup process, prompting you to configure various options such as the project name, author, and output format.

3. **Generate HTML Documentation**: Once Sphinx is initialized, you can generate the HTML documentation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   make html
   ```

   This command will build the HTML files from your reStructuredText source files and place them in the specified output directory.

With these steps completed, you'll have a fully functional Sphinx documentation setup for your project, allowing you to easily create and maintain documentation for your codebase.
